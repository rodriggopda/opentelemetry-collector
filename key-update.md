# Key update

I'm very sorry about this because the current warehouse has undergone an organizational migration.

**ginkgoo-ai -> personal account(wangxd)**

For this, friends who have already deployed it on railway, you have the following three options

1. Redeployment is required (if the data is not critical)
2. Manually change the new GitHub repository address
3. No changes are needed and it will not affect the use of the running application
